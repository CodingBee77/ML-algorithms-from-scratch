# ML-algorithms-from-scratch
Some of machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch in python:
- 'Least_squared_stat' - implement the method of Least squares as statistical porcedure to find best fit line for a set of data points by calculating slope and y-intercept values 
- 'Least_squared_normal_equation' - implement the Least squares method using algebraic equation called normal equation
- 'Gradient_descent' - computes 3 different versions of the most popular optimization algorithm: batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent and mini batch gradient descent
